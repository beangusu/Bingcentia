## Lots of gameplay is the same as _Licentia_, but lots of it has also been changed up! This document mentions mechanics that are present in _Licentia_ as well as new changes in _Bingcentia_

## Combat
I've set up this fork with [Samsy's Combat Guide](https://samsytheunicorn.github.io/licentia-combat.html) as a base, with some mods like _SkySa_ and its add-ons removed (will be added in later versions however)

## Added Player Homes

For those who dislike LOTD, but would like a really cool player home!

- [Tiny Mage Home in Riften](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12929)
- [Astronomer's Loft - Library Home in Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38059)
- [Solitude Rectory - Imperial Temple Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23735)
- [Terra Umbra - Mobile Floating Island](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23845)

## Vampires and Sun Damage
I've included a mechanic I've made so that, as a vampire, you do not take sun damage when wearing a hood or a helmet. So now you can run around during the day as a vamp >:). HOWEVER, this applies to NPCs as well. If they wear a hood or a helmet, they take no sun damage also (hehe). Additionally, completing the Blueblood Quest also adds several perks to get rid of sun damage.

## Conduit
Due to this mod, we can have some really cool spellsword builds. It allows you to hold a weapon in one hand with a spell in the other, and "conduct" the spell through that weapon. Give the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023) a lookie if you're curious on how it works.

## Leveling up

This list uses Static Skill Leveling, just like Licentia. The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat (Magicka, Health, Stamina), then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded skills. 

The uncapper preset also prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill doesn't go up any further, try gaining a level!


## Stackable Stones of Barenziah and Hide your Quests
Pretty self-explanatory if you've seen these mods in other list, but to keep it short, you can now stack the Stones of Barenziah in your inventory along with having new quest markers for each of them. Hide your Quests allows you to yeet quests from your journal, so yeet away my frens.

## WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ under powered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.
