# Bingcentia Configuration

## Ultrawide
If you have an Ultrawide monitor, I've included a fix for Dialogue Interface Reshaped. Under the MO2 separator labeled `Possible Ultrawide Fixes` is the mod you can enable to get it working. 

There may be steps you can take such as reinstalling `Dear Diary`, but these are **unsupported** because I can't help you get it working or test problems with it because I don't have Ultrawide. You can always refer to other Wabbajack READMEs or type use the search bar in discord to look for other people's experiences.

## Copy and Paste in Console
By default, this mod is set to be Ctrl + Left Shift. 

If you want to change this to how you like it:
1. Double-click the mod name in MO2 → navigate to the INI tab → change the paste key code using this document https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script
2. Press save in the top left corner to apply your changes
3. Close out of the window, and you're done

## ENB
This list comes shipped with FNENB/NLA Weathers along with Vicious Reshade. If you no likey, you could edit the values by pressing the `END` key on your keyboard to bring up the GUI, try out some reshades from the Nexus, or just ask in the unofficial support channel on how to remove it so you can add your favorite weather mod :)

## Using A Controller

Due to incompatibilities with _OStim's_ FreeCam, Caco has disabled all controller mods by default. The mods can be found under "Controller Options", but serve no purpose so long as you use a mouse and keyboard. However, if you wish to play with a controller, you will have to **enable all these mods** and **delete any ControlMap_Custom" file(s) in your Skyrim game directory.** 

_If there is no such file in your Skyrim directory, you do not need to worry about it. Just make certain one is not present._

These are Caco's recommendations:

> You will have to configure `The Ultimate Dodge Mod` (I recommend D-Pad Down for Sneak), and `Quick Light` (I recommend D-Pad Up), and `True Directional Movement` (D-Pad Left for Lock-On). I typically assign the same one as Dual-Wield Blocking (LB). Finally, reconfigure your `QuickSave` and `QuickLoad` keys in-game. You must ALSO recall that almost ALL OStim navigation can only be accomplished via the keyboard, so you will have to either switch back and forth or set to autopilot. When all is said and done the Gamepad controls will be as follows:
>- Start: Journal
>- Back: Wait
>- LT: Left Attack
>- RT: Right attack
>- LB+Back: Quicksave
>- RB+Start: Tween menu
>- LB+RB: Shout (in that order, you kinda have to roll your fingers across them)
>- LB: Dual Wield Blocking
>- RB: Sprint,
>- LS: Favorites
>- RS: Switch POV
>- A: Activate
>- X: Ready weapon
>- Y: Jump
>- D-Pad Up: Turn on / off Quick Light
>- D-Pad Down: Sneak / Stop Sneaking
>- D-Pad Left: Lock On
 
 *You will probably crouch up and down and turn lights on and off in dialog menus. Use the sticks instead!*

# WARNING!

A handful of mods in this list contain sexual content that may be a bit too "raw" for some players, namely `Amorous Adventures` and` OStim Solutions`, which feature potentially disturbing content including graphic depictions of outlandish fetishes and/or non-consensual sex. However, Caco has gone out of his way to alter them so that all of them are optional and/or clearly marked as offensive. None of this content will be "sprung" on you without your consent. If you wish to avoid them, ensure that you _do not select any dialog options with a "disturbing content" warning._

## Disabling NSFW

You may wish for the sex part of the list to be completely optional. While you cannot remove the adult dialog options without reworking most of the list, you **can** ensure that any pornographic imagery only takes place when you choose for it to. On the left pane of MO2, there is a mod named `ONights`. This ESP enables NPCs in the game to have sex with each other on their own without your input. Once again, you must disable it **ONLY BEFORE CHOOSING NEW GAME.** Doing so at any other time will cause issues. 

Still want to sleep your way around Skyrim without straight-up watching porn? Thanks to _Licentia_ users, we have an option for that now as well. In addition to the above options, simply enable the `OFadeToBlack` mod in its corresponding MCM menu, and disable the stripping of `Slots 49 and 56` in Ostim's `Undressing` MCM section. This will cause the screen to Fade To Black every time a sex scene begins, so you can still get the quest rewards without the NSFW. On top of that, you'll want to tick on the `Undies.esp` on very bottom of the right pane in MO2. This'll give everyone a pair of lootable underwear, so you don't get jumpscared with nakey people when looting them.

I do have a bit of a warning here, however. Although distribution is rather rare, there are still a few skimpy outfits sprinkled throughout the list. This option was left enabled since lots of _Licentia_ users enjoy that. To be more specific, the Khajiit caravans sell extremely slooty armors from _BD's Armor Replacer_ (which are basically bikinis from _TAWOBA_) and some of the skimpier outfits from _The Book of UUNP_ can sometimes be found on NPCs.

# Character Creation

Creating a face is very time consuming, so many presets are included. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset:
>A or AL - Altmer, AR - Argonian, BO - Bosmer, BR - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, K - Khajiit, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard. 

Many of these faces also come with a "Sculpt" as well, so click the _Sculpt_ menu and import the `NIF` that matches your preset.

Tweak to your liking, but bear in mind that many of the hairstyles will **NOT** look right until you select the `High Poly Head` by navigating to the `Head` portion of RaceMenu and choosing `Face Part 3`.

**IF YOUR BODY OR FACE TURN PURPLE OR OTHERWISE WEIRD**, scroll Racemenu over to _Body Paint_ and make sure all Textures are set to _Default_ (press the "T" key)

# Post Character Creation

## In-Game MCM Options

**DO NOTHING AT ALL** until the messages in the top left corner stop appearing. This is the most script intensive part of the game and may break otherwise.

Almost every MCM is also now automated thanks to MCM Recorder! When the messages in the top left corner stop appearing, click `OK` on MCM Recorder's box to let it do its thing.

## Follower Framework

Not strictly necessary, but your followers may wander around at times without this step. Go to **Activity** and enable _Only Sandbox in Town._ If you don't want your followers using your crafting stations, also enable _Ignore Special Furniture_

## OStim

The settings in this extensive mod are almost all down to personal preference. I recommend you simply "Import Settings" to get my recommendations (scroll all the way down, on the right). If you wish to customize the settings further, I recommend you read about the whole Suite of mods on Nexus. It's pretty cool stuff.

### How To Use This Mod

OStim/OSex is a little tough to get used to but the gist is that you use 8,4,5, and 6 on the NUMPAD like another set of WASD keys to move around in the OSex menus. 7 chooses a command, 9 swaps actors or functions, 1 cancels a command. + is inspect or advance scene, enter is open or close menu. Period or decimal ends the scene. Freecam is now enabled, but not automatically. Press the forward slash key on the NUMPAD to activate it.

Personally as a despicable Boomer and former data entry clerk at UPS, the fact that people willingly choose to do without NUMPADs both disturbs and angers me. But I know it's a thing. If you don't have one, no problem. You can hold down **F8** for 10 seconds to rebind all of OSex's default controls. Good luck finding keys that aren't already in use.

If you encounter a scene that is terribly out of alignment, press the L key to open a menu with tons of options for adjustments (this is the OAlign mod). If you save your changes they will persist for that animation.

At any time you can go up to anyone and press the up arrow to have OSex sex with them. **NOTE: DO NOT INITIATE SEX WITH THE STANDARD OSA MENUS!** (Available via the ENTER key on your numpad.) _OStim_ overrides these, so they will not function.

Creatures do not function with OSex and I have no plans to ever implement them.

## Immersive Equipment Displays

This mod allows your character + NPCs to have weapons, coin bags, potions, etc. displayed. Basically ALLGUD but better. By default, the list comes with Missile's IED Preset and needs a few steps to set up.

1. Press the Backspace button to open the Immersive Equipment Displays GUI
2. Make sure Sync is unchecked before you touch anything!
3. Click on view ⇾ gear positioning ⇾ "Missile - Gear Positioning" in the preset drop down menu
4. Click merge and OK
 
**IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR SWORD ON YOUR BACK OR WITCHER STYLE LEFT SWORDS:**
 
 In the gear positioning window, select the "Placement" bubble. You can edit the placements of the weapons there

**Weapons don't show without Cuirass or Clothes**

1. Open the GUI ⇾ view ⇾ Equipment ⇾ Select "Missile Weapons - No Body" ⇾ Click merge and accept
   
I would also recommend doing this for NPCs as well:

2. In Equipment ⇾ Select the "Global" tab ⇾ Click on the NPC bubble ⇾ Select "Missile Weapons - No Body" and merge

**Misc Items, Quest Items, and Headhunter Presets:**

- Open the GUI ⇾ view ⇾ Custom ⇾ Make sure you are on the "NPC" tab, and it is on your character at the top ⇾ Select either "Missile - Quest Items", "Missile - Misc Items", or "Missile - Headhunter" ⇾ Click merge and accept

NPC Items:
1. In the custom view, select the tab "Global" ⇾ Select "Missile - NPCs" ⇾ Click on merge and accept

## Quick Light

Just as a note here, the free lantern can be turned on at any time by striking the 'NUMPAD 1' key or holding down the `Activate` button (`E` on keyboard, `A` on Gamepad). The keys for this can be changed in this MCM, as well as the brightness and style of the lantern.

## Skyrim Outfit System

This section is brought to you entirely by my devoted user `Palentier` who was convinced someting was wrong with this mod, prompting me to remove it, pissed off half my server, then made amends by realizing his mistake and writing this guide. Thanks a lot, man!

This mod allows you to have multiple outfit appearances that can be saved, favorited and switched or removed totally with the "Change Outfit" power. This mod allows you to wear any Armor including shields and jewelry while maintaining the appearance of the set you saved.  So you can get your Characters Look exactly how you want it, while wearing the stuff you need to buff your character with.

Using this Mod is optional, but you MUST use the "Change Outfit" Power and select [NO OUTFIT] if you wish to see your character nude for Ostim scenes.  This power can be used after starting the scene if you forget to turn it off before the scene begins.  WARNING: The setting under Outfit settings (while creating a new Outfit) "Require Equipped Armors" **WILL NOT REMOVE YOUR UNDERWEAR.**  You must manually select [NO OUTFIT] each time you start a scene.

_You must Favorite an Outfit to see it in the Change Outfit Power Menu_
