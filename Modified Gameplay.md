# Some gameplay has been modified quite a bit from _Licentia_ while some gameplay has stayed exactly the same. 
**Please read entirely in case you're not familiar with Licentia's mechanics and to read some new ones!**

## Copy and Paste in Console
By default, this mod is set to be Ctrl + Left Shift. 

If you want to change this to how you like it:
1. Double-click the mod name in MO2 → navigate to the INI tab → change the paste key code using this document https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script
2. Press save in the top left corner to apply your changes
3. Close out of the window, and you're done

## Vampires and Sun Damage
I've included a patch I've made so that, as a vampire, you do not take sun damage when wearing a hood or a helmet. So feel free to run around with during the day as a vamp! HOWEVER, this applies to NPCs as well, if they wear a hood or a helmet, they take no sun damage (hehe) Additionally, completing the Blueblood Quest, also adds several perks to get rid of sun damage.

## Dual Wield Blocking and TUDM Attack Cancel
I removed CGO, so I figured I'd add a way for people to dual wield block still. [Key Bindable Dual Wield Blocking and Parrying](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16334?tab=description) allows you to block while dual wielding and adds a new keybind for the new block key. On top of that, with TUDM Attack Cancel, you can wind up your attack and press your block key to cancel the animation to block instead! Or you can just dodge and cancel your attacks.

## Leveling up

This list uses Static Skill Leveling, just like Licentia. The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat (Magicka, Health, Stamina), then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded skills. 

The uncapper preset also prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill doesn't go up any further, try gaining a level!

## WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ under powered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.
