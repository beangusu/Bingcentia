## Leveling up

This list uses Static Skill Leveling, just like Licentia. The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat (Magicka, Health, Stamina), then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded skills. 

The uncapper preset also prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill won't go up any further, try gaining a level!

## Immersive Equipment Displays

This mod allows your character + NPCs to have weapons, coin bags, potions, etc displayed. Basically ALLGUD but better. By default the list comes with Missile's IED Preset and needs a few steps to set up.

1. Press the Backspace button to open the Immersive Equipment Displays GUI
2. Make sure Sync is unchecked before you touch anything!
3. Click on view > gear positioning > "Missile - Gear Positioning" in the preset drop down menu.
4. Click merge and OK
 
**IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR SWORD ON YOUR BACK OR WITCHER STYLE LEFT SWORDS:**
 
 In the gear positioning window, select the "Placement" bubble. You can edit the placements of the weapons there.

**Weapons don't show without Cuirass or Clothes**

1. Open the GUI > view >  Equipment > Select "Missile Weapons - No Body" > Click merge and accept
   
I would also recommend doing this for NPCs as well:

2. In Equipment > Select the "Global" tab > Click on the NPC bubble -> Select "Missile Weapons - No Body" and merge

**Misc Items, Quest Items, and Headhunter Presets:**

- Open the GUI > view > Custom > Make sure you are on the "NPC" tab and it is on your character at the top > Select either "Missile - Quest Items", "Missile - Misc Items", or "Missile - Headhunter" > Click merge and accept

NPC Items:
1. In the custom view, select the tab "Global" -> Select "Missile - NPCs" -> Click on merge and accept


## WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ underpowered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.
