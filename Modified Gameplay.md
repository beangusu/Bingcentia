# Some gameplay has been modified quite a bit from _Licentia_ while some gameplay has stayed exactly the same. 
**Please read this in its entirety in case you're not familiar with Licentia's mechanics and to read some new ones**

## Riften Player Home
I honestly just really like Riften, so I added a [tiny mage home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12929) on top of the home collection we have in the list already. The home is tucked away on the bottom level of Black-Briar Meadery's exterior in Riften's docks and features an enchanting table, safe storage for your stuff, a cooking station, and fun static clutter. The house is navmeshed too so feel free to bring your followers. 

## Vampires and Sun Damage
I've included a mechanic I've made so that, as a vampire, you do not take sun damage when wearing a hood or a helmet. So feel free to run around with during the day as a vamp! HOWEVER, this applies to NPCs as well, if they wear a hood or a helmet, they  take no sun damage as well (hehe). Additionally, completing the Blueblood Quest also adds several perks to get rid of sun damage.

## Conduit
Due to this mod, we can have some really cool spellsword builds. It allows you to hold a weapon in one hand with a spell in the other, and "conduct" the spell through that weapon. Give the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023) a lookie if you're curious on how it works.

## Dual Wield Blocking and TUDM Attack Cancel
I removed CGO, so I figured I'd add a way for people to dual wield block still. [Key Bindable Dual Wield Blocking and Parrying](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16334?tab=description) allows you to block while dual wielding and adds a new keybind for the new block key. On top of that, with [TUDM Attack Cancel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40313?tab=files), you can dodge to cancel your attacks.


## Leveling up

This list uses Static Skill Leveling, just like Licentia. The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat (Magicka, Health, Stamina), then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded skills. 

The uncapper preset also prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill doesn't go up any further, try gaining a level!


## Stackable Stones of Barenziah and Hide your Quests
Pretty self-explanatory if you've seen these mods in other list, but to keep it short, you can now stack the stones of Barenziah in your inventory along with having new quest markers for each of them. Hide your Quests allows you to yeet quests from your journal, feel free to configure that how you like in the MCM.

## WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ under powered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.
